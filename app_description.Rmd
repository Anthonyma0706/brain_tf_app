## Goal  
* This app displays transcription factor activity inference data from a developmental timecourse of the mouse forebrain in pons in three main tabs including:

  - Tab 1 (tf and gene datatable and network graph): Given a list of TFs, display a table of those TFs with their inferred target genes, Normalized Enrichment Score (NES) representing the activity level, motifs, etc. Secondly, based the same gene regulatory network, a network graph visualization displaying the TF and targets, where overlaps in targets of different TFs can be visualized easily. Color and size of nodes designate different types of genes. Genes (nodes) which are part of a user-defined list can also be coloured to highlight members of a pathway.

  - Tab 2 (heatmap and UMAP clustering plot): For this tab, we visualize the activity levels of transcription at the cell and cluster level.

  Firstly, two heatmaps visualize the activity per cluster/cell, with cells annotated by cluster. Secondly, we show the TF activity in the cells in a two-dimensional embedding (UMAP), to highlight regions (clusters/cell types) with high activity.

  - Tab 3 (timeseries ribbon plot), we use the binarized TF activity to plot the proportion of cells where the TF is active at each timepoint during embryonic and postnatal development (E12.5, E15.5, P0, P3, P6). Moreover, we use plotly to display an interactive data visualization – hover over the plot to display the cluster label, and click on the cell type legend to restrict the visualization to selected clusters of interest.

  
More details of functions of each tab will be shown later, with major aspects: user input, output, datasets, libraries required and possible demos of plot/table

## recent updates:
- control the size of plots (tab2)
- make a plot list first then plot using plot_grid or plotly::sub_plot
- change the color palette of tab2 heatmap, remove all the prefixes(F-E12...)
- add analyze by pathway features in tab1 cytoscape network
- add download buttons of plots


## Final instructions to be added:  
- data structures: how I save all the data of different brain regions...
- rintrojs: 
  - sidebar first,   
  - introduce the data, then how to plot them...(parameters and functionalities of the plots)
  - explain plotly plots, the interactivity and fancy features
  
- add more instructions on cytoscape network feature, how to control colors...


## Second phase after prototype:  
Main modifications:  
- combine pons and cortex datasets together, they have the same format for all data, choose the data structure to save them and assign in app.R using list  
- add options of plotting by cell or cluster in the second tab, add color palette designed/commonly recognized in Kleinman lab  
- write new functions and add new parameters in order to reconcile the demand of easier coding, better readability and switch between two brain region datasets  

Further issue/modification required:   
- change the legend (color palette) of tab2 heatmaps
- (width, height ...) -> maybe see complex heatmap if it has better control options interactively  
- heatmap, show a picture of the cluster color palette  
- tab1: display an additional table for the graph network  
- Modify tab3 function to suit the pons data  
- - plotly, complex heatmap features to be applied in this app  
- support multiple plots of scatterplot in tab2 also add a title name by the tf  
- error message? Use a function? Any example online?  
  + show error of missing TFs?   
  + in psuedotime?  
  + add explanation of the missing TF in activity_cell datasets  
- consider some customization features (CSS...) since we've had a good prototype that supports basic functionality  
- get a taste of some real research activitie, maybe using what I developed...  


## To-do list and questions: 

### things need to learn: 
- Hackathon:  
  - plotly, complex heatmap
- Monday meeting:  
  - show error of missing TFs?  
  - in psuedotime?  
  - add explanation of the missing TF in activity_cell datasets  
  
- organize data  
  + name datasets with different prefix according to brain region  
  + import all datasets initially before ui and server function except big datasets, feather data  
  + put data in reactive if that involves input$TF and frequently needs to be updated


### unsolved: 

- Professor mentioned: static data... (construct this in a big picture... design ability to switch 2 brain regions from the very beginning, and so on. Get a bunch of user input as a vector? then use that vector to do things accordingly and automatically, instead of hardcoding?) maybe this can apply to the theme(parameters of plot...) of the app, but what about other features?
  1. data  
  2. element for the data  
  3. **style** for that element ??
  4. theme elements??

- May 15: New ideas:
  1. User input can be:
    - empty -> we choose one to display initially
    - error (TF not found...) might not be a problem because we let user to select from a given active_TF vector
    - one TF (trivial case)
    - a list of TF (user can select multiple TF from either):
        - direct typing or 
        - **interacting with the graph nodes plot generated from Tab1(cola feature).**  
  2. Keep several layouts in one page  
  3. HEATMAP:  
    - display the **complex heatmap** using that package, that can **interact with user**  
    - Intially, display the heatmap for all the TF(each row is a TF), then user can select several TF to subset the graph
      + This input can also be *taken from the input list form step 1*  
  
  4. Template (general)
    - **Format contents in different blocks** (instead of hardcoding each situation,
    **but not writing functions?**)
    - ex. A block of code that interacts with user input (TF vector) and

- why can NES have negative value?  
- group those clusters further? neuron.. epithelial...? in Tab2 cluster plot  

### solved: 
- What input do heatmap, scatterplot cluster base on?  - still TF
- display a small table of datasets for demonstration - success
- implementation of UMAP into code, any package? - no need for it, just two columns of forehead data  
- assign training sets to the corresponding tab/plot  
- Detailed definition of joint cortex? - have 5 time plots of pon and forebrain cluster data then join them again into a whole plot to see the relations and correlations of each cell

## Library, remember to install rcytoscapejs2 from github first
```{r , message= FALSE}
library(rcytoscapejs2) # need to install from github, https://github.com/uc-bd2k/rcytoscapejs2

library(shiny)
library(tidyr) # or you may use 
library(stringr)
library(readr)
library(tibble)
library(dplyr)
library(feather)
library(ggplot2)
library(plotly)
library(pheatmap)
library(DT)
library(glue)

load("data/joint_cortex/cortex_prep.Rda") # a list, data_cortex
load("data/joint_pons/pons_prep.Rda")     # a list, data_pons
load("data/shared/common_prep.Rda") # metadata and colour_palettes
source("functions.R")
```


## Datasets
We now only show the cortex data for demonstration, but pons data and data for other brain regions will have the same format.
Our central dogma is to code things (plots, helper functions to generate data, etc) in functions with parameters of *region* or *method*(plot ... by cluster/cell) to control the behavior  
### 1. Metadata of cluster information  
```{r,results='asis', message= FALSE}
metadata <- read_tsv("data/shared/metadata_20190716.tsv")
to_display <- select(metadata, -Signature)
knitr::kable(to_display[1:5,1:10], caption = "Table demo [1:5,1:10]")
```  

* with the important columns being:
  + Cluster (matching all the data)
  + Cell_type (the full name of the cell type)
  + Age (the time point of the sample)
  + Colour (a hex value to use as a colour for that cluster)
  
* Used for making the color palette  

### 2. Forebrain cell metadata (Cortex cell metadata)
```{r,results='asis', message= FALSE}
forebrain_data <- read_tsv("data/joint_cortex/Forebrain_join.2D.tsv")
knitr::kable(forebrain_data[1:5,], caption = "Table demo")
```

Contains cells from all mouse forebrain samples with joint cluster information and 2D PCA, tSNE and UMAP coordinates in joint space. Clustering/tSNE coordinates are as in Extended Data Figure 1e. The Cell column matches the other datasets, and the **two columns** to use to make scatter plots are **UMAP1 (x-axis) and UMAP2 (y-axis)**.

### 3. Active TF data
```{r,results='asis', message= FALSE}
TF_active <- read_rds("data/joint_cortex/joint_cortex.active_regulons.Rds") # a vector
knitr::kable(TF_active[1:10], caption = "Table demo")
```

Vector of transcription factors declared as active in the sample  
**Note:** will be cleaned by trimming the weights and extensions.  

### 4. TF's target gene data
```{r,results='asis', message= FALSE}
TF_target_gene_info <- read_rds("data/joint_cortex/joint_cortex.regulon_target_info.Rds")
knitr::kable(TF_target_gene_info[1:5,], caption = "Table demo")
```

Table indicating the targets ("gene") for each transcription factor ("TF"), and information about the target, including weight and activity

### Activity data (with respect to cell/cluster) 

#### 5. Activity per cluster
```{r,results='asis', message= FALSE}
activity_cluster <- read_feather("data/joint_cortex/joint_cortex.regulon_activity_per_cluster.feather")
knitr::kable(activity_cluster[1:5,1:5], caption = "Table demo")
```

A dataframe, the first column is cluster, subsequent columns correspond to active TF (TF_active) the values describe the NES(activity score of TF in each cluster)

#### 6. Activity per cell 
```{r,results='asis', message= FALSE}
activity_cell <- read_feather("data/joint_cortex/joint_cortex.regulon_activity_per_cell.feather")
knitr::kable(activity_cell[1:5,1:5], caption = "Table demo")
```

The first column changes to cell, we use this for the UMAP cluster scatterplot in tab2.

## 2. Heatmap and cluster scatterplot
- discription: Given user's TF input, display a heatmap and clustering scatterplot
- **package**:  
```
library(shiny)
library(ggplot2)
library(pheatmap)
```
- data: 4.TF_target_gene_info, 5. Activity per cluster, 6. Activity per cell
- input: a transcription factor, chosen from (3. Active TF data) vector TF_active
- output: 
  1. A heatmap that, given a specific TF, we filter the activity_cluster datasets with this TF then display a heatmap that shows the level of activity featured by NES(score). You will see a gradient of color which makes a great straightforwad visualization.  
  The x-axis correspond to each cluster.  
  
  
### Option 1: plot by Cluster, Note that later in the app we will use function plot_heatmap() for easier control between regions and methods(by cell or cluster)
```{r}
metadata <- read_tsv("data/shared/metadata_20190716.tsv")
colour_palette_cluster <- metadata %>% 
  # use gsub to change all contents in Cluster (cluster name format)
  mutate(Cluster = gsub("_", " ", Cluster)) %>% 
  # Get two columns
  select(Cluster, Colour) %>% 
  # Convert to vector of colours, where the first column gives the names
  # and the second column is converted to the values
  deframe() # VECTOR , not data frame 

# A helper function to prepare a dataframe to annotate the heatmap with colours


hm_anno <- makePheatmapAnno(colour_palette_cluster, "Cluster")

# There are many samples of cluster, collected from different timepoints, while they're the
# same, but having different timepoints prefix, for example: F-e12 VRGC and F-p0 VRGC,
# we remove all the prefix, using the same color palette

  mutate(Cluster = gsub(pattern = ".* ", replacement = "", Cluster))

### Pheatmap recap: how to make annotation_col or row  
```{r eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
library(pheatmap)

# Create test matrix
test = matrix(rnorm(200), 20, 10)
test[1:10, seq(1, 10, 2)] = test[1:10, seq(1, 10, 2)] + 3
test[11:20, seq(2, 10, 2)] = test[11:20, seq(2, 10, 2)] + 2
test[15:20, seq(2, 10, 2)] = test[15:20, seq(2, 10, 2)] + 4
colnames(test) = paste("Test", 1:10, sep = "")
rownames(test) = paste("Gene", 1:20, sep = "")
# Generate annotations for rows and columns
annotation_col = data.frame(
                    CellType = factor(rep(c("CT1", "CT2"), 5)), 
                    Time = 1:5
                )
rownames(annotation_col) = paste("Test", 1:10, sep = "")

annotation_row = data.frame(
                    GeneClass = factor(rep(c("Path1", "Path2", "Path3"), c(10, 4, 6)))
                )
rownames(annotation_row) = paste("Gene", 1:20, sep = "")

# Display row and color annotations
# Draw heatmaps
pheatmap(test)
# pheatmap(test, kmeans_k = 2)

pheatmap(test, annotation_col = annotation_col)
pheatmap(test, annotation_col = annotation_col, annotation_legend = FALSE)
pheatmap(test, annotation_col = annotation_col, annotation_row = annotation_row)

# test
 annotation_col
# annotation_row
```


 
  2. A scatterplot that plots a scatter plot using UMAP1 and UMAP2 in forebrain_data, then given a user input of TF, using the 6. Activity per cell: activity_cell, change the color of each cell to reflect their TF activity, based on the user input of TF

## 3. Time series plot
- discription: Given user's TF input, plot a time series trajectory of TF activity in several time points, not in pseudotime for now.
- **package**:  
```
library(ggplot2)
```
- data: 4.TF_target_gene_info, 5. Activity per cluster, 6. Activity per cell
- input: a transcription factor, chosen from (3. Active TF data) vector TF_active
- output: A time series plot of TF activity in pseudotime
![alt text](data/image/timeseries_1.png)  
Here each dot corresponds to a cell and we can see the type from the colors.
However, in our plot, we are displaying TF activity so the y-axis should be TF activity instead of expression level.

## First, make color palette for plotting
```{r}
colour_palette <- metadata %>% 
  mutate(Cluster = gsub("_", " ", Cluster)) %>% 
  separate(Cluster, into = c("Prefix", "Cluster"), sep = " ") %>% 
  # Get two columns
  select(Cluster, Colour) %>% 
  distinct(Cluster, .keep_all = TRUE) %>% 
  # Convert to vector of colours, where the first column gives the names
  # and the second column is converted to the values
  deframe()
head(colour_palette)

```
load the cell metadata
```{r}
cell_metadata <- read_tsv("data/joint_cortex/joint_cortex.metadata.tsv") %>% 
  select(Age = orig.ident, Cell, Cluster = ID_20190730_with_blacklist_and_refined) %>% 
  # In this case, we remove the "prefix" of the Cluster column, so that we are
  # simply left with the abbreviation representing the cell type, so that 
  # we can link the cells of the same cell type across ages
  separate(Cluster, into = c("Prefix", "Cluster"), sep = "_") %>% 
  mutate(Age = factor(Age, levels = c("Forebrain E12.5",
                                      "Forebrain E15.5",
                                      "Forebrain P0",
                                      "Forebrain P3",
                                      "Forebrain P6"))) %>% 
  arrange(Cell)
head(cell_metadata)
```
Load the binary TF activity
```{r}

activity <- readRDS("data/joint_cortex/joint_cortex.binaryRegulonActivity_nonDupl.Rds")

activity[1:3, 1:3]

```
```{r}
# This step will change depending on the TF used
TF <- "Dlx1 (16g)" # input_tf

activity <- activity[TF, ] %>% 
  {data.frame("TF" = .)} %>% 
  tibble::rownames_to_column(var = "Cell") %>% # the original activity vector has names
  arrange(Cell)

```

Prep a tidy data frame:

```{r}

# Double check all Cell names are the same / in same order
all(cell_metadata$Cell == activity$Cell)

# Add the TF activity to the new dataframe
ribbon_df <- cell_metadata
ribbon_df$TF <- activity$TF

ribbon_df <- ribbon_df %>% 
  filter(!grepl("BLACKLIST", Cluster))

head(cell_metadata)

```

Use the function to make the plot:
Use the specific cell metadata and activity to the brain region

Plot by **pseudotime**: cells that captured at same time will vary vastly in their stage in development progress. To avoid this problem, rather than ploting the changes according to the age, we plot as a function of progress with respect to each cell along its own trajectory, which we term "pseudotime".
